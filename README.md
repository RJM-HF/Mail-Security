HomeFortress is a centralized, public resource hosted on GitHub Pages that aggregates critical email security and branding filesâ€”all in one place.
With a custom CNAME (mta-sts.homefortress.space) set up for MTA-STS, HomeFortress serves your MTA-STS policy, security.txt, and BIMI logo (in SVG format) securely over HTTPS.
This unified page makes it simple for both external parties and internal stakeholders to verify your email security posture and brand authenticity.
